## Let’s be honest about wedding ceremonies
Most couples spend months obsessing over the food, the flowers, the seating plan…

Then suddenly it’s:
“Oh. We should probably think about the ceremony.”

And yet - this is the bit that actually matters.

Not the chair covers.  
Not the colour of the napkins.  
The moment you stand in front of your people and say *this is my person*.

Designing a wedding ceremony isn’t about being dramatic or “alternative”.
It’s about creating something that doesn’t feel borrowed from someone else’s day.


## Start with the emotional arc (not the order of service)
Every meaningful wedding ceremony has the same invisible structure:

**Arrival → anticipation → connection → commitment → release**

When couples feel stuck, it’s usually because they’re trying to fill time instead of shape feeling.

Ask yourselves:
- How do we want people to feel when they sit down?
- When do we want the emotion to peak?
- Where do we want things to soften again?

Once you understand the emotional flow, the decisions get easier:
- music choices
- readings
- who speaks
- how long things last  

This is how you design a ceremony that feels intentional rather than stitched together.

## Personal doesn’t mean public
A common fear:
“If we personalise it, it’ll feel cringe.”

It won’t - if you do it *selectively*.

You don’t need:
- ten readings
- a full relationship backstory
- inside jokes half the room won’t get  

You *do* need:
- one or two moments that are unmistakably you
- language that sounds like a human, not a script
- space to breathe  

The most memorable ceremonies are restrained, not overworked.

## Rituals work best when they’re simple
Unity rituals don’t need explaining slides or nervous laughter.

The best ones:
- are visually clear
- take under two minutes
- mean something to *you*, even if guests don’t know why  

That could be:
- lighting a candle together
- planting something symbolic
- a quiet pause before vows  

If it needs a paragraph of explanation, it’s doing too much.

## The ceremony sets the tone for the entire day

This is something most couples realise *after* the wedding.

A calm, grounded ceremony:
- settles nerves
- pulls guests into the moment
- makes the rest of the day feel intentional rather than rushed  

When the ceremony feels right, everything else flows better - speeches, drinks, dancing, all of it.

## Designing your ceremony shouldn’t add stress

If planning your ceremony feels heavy, that’s not a personal failing.
It’s usually because no one gives couples a clear way to think through it calmly.

At Do Tell The Bride, we believe:
- clarity beats perfection
- emotion matters as much as logistics
- your ceremony should feel like *home*, not a performance  

The goal isn’t to impress.
It’s to feel present.

And that’s the part people remember.

## How long should a wedding ceremony be?
Most modern wedding ceremonies last 20–30 minutes.

Longer than that, and guests start shifting.
Shorter than that, and it can feel rushed.

The sweet spot:

enough time to feel meaningful

not so long that people disconnect

If you’re choosing between adding another reading or keeping things tight, choose tight. Presence beats padding every time.
